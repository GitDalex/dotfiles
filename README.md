Long time user/hacker of Linux, under a lot of distributions (historically) like [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/), [RedHat](https://www.redhat.com/en) -and since [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/en/)-, Mandriva (now dead),[Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) (and its variants : [Kubuntu](https://kubuntu.org/),[Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org/)...), [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) (and its numerous variants like [AVLinux](http://www.bandshed.net/avlinux/) -one of the last I found for use with sound and multimedia- or [Linux Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) -wich I install on friends' computers coming from W...$ and wanting to try Linux - ...

But for my own usage, I have finished my travels between them with [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) ... the easyest and confortable way to [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org/).
